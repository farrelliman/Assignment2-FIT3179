        <h3>
            An interesting thing to note here is, while modern cuisine has the highest amount of total restaurants with Michelin Stars. Contemporary cuisine has the most restaurants with Two and Three stars.
        </h3>

        <div id="heatmap"></div>
        <h4>
            Here we can see the relationship between the different regions and their prefered cuisine. We can see that for contemporary cuisine, California has the most acclaimed restaurants. 
        </h4>
        <h4>    
            As for modern cuisine, the place to go is the United Kingdom. Additionally, the United Kingdom also has the most variation in their Michelin Star restaurants.
        </h4>

            </div>
        <h5>
            Finally, lets compare the quality of these restaurants to their respective price points!.  Whats expected here is that most three michelin star restaurants fall under the high price range, but its interesting to note that most of them aren't on the highest price bracket.
